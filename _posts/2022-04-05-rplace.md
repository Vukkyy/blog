So far, if you'd ask me what thing on the internet I loved the most, it's r/place. As such, I'll (very poorly, as this is my first blog post) try to tell you the story about the Vukky artwork, with lots of slightly interesting images!

*Note: Vukky (the character) has no particular pronouns.*

*Double note: I'm sorry if there are too many images here. I haven't gotten to use images before! Such power!*

## The beginning
I and Skelly discover that the event started, and we quickly scramble to build something. 
We chose the very random location of (590, 900) which will become very important later.
We also decided that this artwork I had made previously should be the one that should be built on the canvas.

Unfortunately, I discovered that r/place wasn't loading in Firefox! So I opened the mobile app while Skelly prepared to place pixels. A blueprint was then prepared.

And so, the Vukky building began:

While we were building, someone gave the Vukky funny feet, which would survive for some time.

## Cave Story arc

The Vukky got built! 

Just for fun, I decided to check The Snakeroom's Discord server to see if they had any new discoveries about this event. I quickly noticed that they had created a diplomacy channel.

After some (short) thinking, we decided to post about the Vukky there.

A bit afterwards, someone from the Cave Story Discord reaches out to me about the fact that we are in the way of their artwork.

Some unprofessional DMs later, we make a truce, which would later turn into an alliance. We would also move the Vukky later so that they could build their artwork uninterrupted.

### Vandalism time!
Unfortunately, at this point a group (that I won't disclose the name of) was drawing a penis on the Vukky! However, they explained that it was a joke after some arguing, and it was removed.

During that, people were mistaking the Vukky for an Among Us character, and gave it a backpack which was removed. The Vukky's eyes would also be repeatedly removed and recreated, you know, general random pixel placing.

### New home
After that, it was time to move, as they were clearly running over the old Vukky!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161730145-730f919f-b3ff-455a-8c86-ba9e5ebcae63.png)

Rebuilding it took longer than I had hoped, but we managed to do so eventually. Here's a work-in-progress picture:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161730462-7180716a-f4b8-47bc-9b72-2f677a82bfee.png)

Coincidentally, this spot also happened to have Firey from BFDI next to it! Sadly, on multiple occasions, they wanted to eat the Vukky to build their own artwork, but that never happened. In addition, this meant that Vukky had to lose his right arm, since BFDI had already taken that area.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161730825-ca6234f6-0bc5-4d32-b10b-e831985311be.png)

And the Vukky is done now!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161730722-e82c7a85-7829-491c-8051-f84a6504658e.png)

People were messing with Vukky's left arm a lot. Here's a... confused Vukky? I'm confused too. The blush eventually became part of the design.

### Sleeping is a terrible idea.

After this, I decided to go to sleep and enter the second day of r/place.

Unfortunately, while I was asleep, Vukky turned purple!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161731467-5a05821a-29d0-4044-bae3-5800127e7bea.png)

By the time I woke back up, people had confused the Vukky with BMO and turned the Vukky into a cyan BMO as such. After a lot of pixel placing, we were able to restore Vukky back to normal, though. This would occur in later days as well, although not as bad as this.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161731656-486ac551-c123-481a-bf0d-a80e93cc9405.png)

The people over at the Cave Story Discord also gave Vukky a purple snow cone, as a treat to ease its suffering.

The snow cone was messed with afterwards.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161732576-f38b08b2-d74e-4dd7-b31f-2497c6103ad6.png)

The Cave Story Discord also figured out a way to get the right arm to fit in, which was quickly applied and remained.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161732889-40eecb24-9c6e-4571-85be-9f1e961511d1.png)

r/place then expanded, but we decided not to build anything in the new space, as we were having trouble maintaining our existing one. This is foreshadowing.

## Day 3: Streamer arc.

Firey started getting voided. They decided to relocate elsewhere.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161734221-669be1dd-953f-412d-b899-4586f4e5691f.png)

Then... game over.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161734357-9934735b-5bce-462e-a729-34e9b075d4e2.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161734435-19b01c61-4e3c-4547-a29e-c9529d07aed7.png)

Vukky was gone. Forever.

...I lied! For comedic effect! We waited until the streamer stopped streaming. The canvas expanded as well, and we tried making a new Vukky there, but it failed horribly.

Cave Story got some of the area back, so we made a new Vukky blueprint.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161735112-1405cb90-193e-4ed1-8a5b-8ebd93ed3aad.png)

But within, like, 7 minutes of posting that blueprint...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46850780/161735196-5db56870-adcf-4fe3-b562-36959acdc4db.png)

There's another streamer! And this time, they killed Cave Story, too! It never ends, does it? However, they acted very nice on camera.

### Vukky saves the day with a simple Reddit post
And so, [I made a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/tvwboy/streamer_bombs_a_small_community_to_draw_some/), which would eventually get 30,000 upvotes, 3 million views, and hit #3 on r/place's Hot view.

Within a few hours, we were back.

It would remain like this for basically the rest of the event.

## Thanks for playing!

The streamer returned to build their logo at the end of the event and did destroy the artwork, but they only managed to build the "K" before it was over.

All the art faded away, as the Reddit admins changed the available colors to just white. There are some things I haven't mentioned here, but there was also a lot of things that were going on.

<small>Interesting thing to note: right when Poland invaded the OneShot sun, the change happened. It's almost as if it released a burst of energy!</small>

Thanks for reading the blog post! It's a bit messy, and I might make some changes, but I think it's... "good enough"... for now.
