I've seen a few people on my Discord server discuss using Freenom, so I'll just compile my thoughts into this blog post. I used Freenom before for my old website called [vukky.ga](https://vukky.vercel.app).

You shouldn't use it for other purposes than a test domain to test random things you don't want to keep on. If your site gets traffic, they'll take it from you and demand that you should pay up. Yes, you can wait, and they'll eventually free it up again, but in the meantime they'll use your domain for advertising their services and/or porn.

Instead, here are some services I'm aware of that cost something, but not too much:
* [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) gives you a subdomain of "omg.lol" for just $5/year, with additional features like a "url.lol" URL shortener and free e-mail forwarding.
* Skelly likes using [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com).

If you just want a free static website and don't care about being under a generic subdomain, here are some options:
* [Neocities](https://neocities.org) (used by me!)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) (used by this blog, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) built in!)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
* [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
