Hi, we're making some changes to LIT Devs today.

## sald binf

The SaladBind roles and channels have been removed from the server, and we are no longer providing non-urgent support for SaladBind in general. The [FAQ](https://wiki.litdevs.org/wiki/SaladBind/FAQ) page is still available and there are no plans to completely discontinue the software at this time.

Due to the removal of the roles, approximately 50 server members got a random DM from YAGPDB. This is because I removed the reactions from the role picker, which made YAGPDB notify those who had signed up for the roles at that time get the DM.

## Financials page removed

We have removed the financials page due to us generally being uncomfortable with this data being available. If you enjoyed looking at it, we apologize.
