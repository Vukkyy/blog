Hi, we're making some changes to LIT Devs today.

## sald binf

**(UPDATE - May 4th, 2022)** - LIT Devs has discontinued the SaladBind software. All users have been migrated to a fork created by someone else.

The SaladBind roles and channels have been removed from our Discord server, and we are no longer providing non-urgent support for SaladBind in general. The [FAQ](https://wiki.litdevs.org/wiki/SaladBind/FAQ) page is still available and there are no plans to completely discontinue the software at this time.

As a result of this, we have pushed an update to SaladBind, 1.7.5, to remove references to our Discord server.

Due to the removal of the roles, approximately 50 server members got a random message from YAGPDB, the role selection bot that we use. This is because I removed the buttons from the role selection channel, which made YAGPDB notify some people who had selected it.

## Financials page removed

We have removed the financials page due to us generally being uncomfortable with this data being available. If you enjoyed looking at it, we apologize.
