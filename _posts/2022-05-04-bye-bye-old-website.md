I forgot to write a blog post about this, so I guess I will now. I accidentally nuked my website, sus.omg.lol.

## How can you screw up that bad??

Well, I connected to the website via Neocities' WebDAV feature, a magical thing(tm) that basically makes your website's source code pop up as a USB drive on your computer! Wow!

Anyway, I decided that I didn't want it there, so instead of unmounting it like a normal person, I ran a command to delete the folder and everything in it. Obviously, this synced to the website, and... it's gone now!

## That just makes you look even more stupid!

I know! I didn't use version control software! No backups! And I'll do it again! You know why?

This has given me a chance to reconstruct the website. So without further ado, visit sus.omg.lol, now with even less content but with fancier credits and a new achievements system!
